# Intro to Dashboard in Python

This repository provides a quick tour of packages useful to build dashboards in Python.


## Installation

The example notebook runs on [Jupyter-on-NeSI](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz), using the kernel `Python 3.10.5 (gimkl-2022a)`.

Or, as an alternative, install all dependencies in a Python virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements
```

then activate it and start JupyterLab to execute the example notebook:

```
. venv/bin/activate
jupyter lab
```


## Getting started

The presentation will follow the [Dashboard Tour](dashboard_tour.ipynb) notebook.


## TODO

- add a self-contained example of panel + hvplot + xarray + datashader for geoscience, maybe use data from https://carpentries-lab.github.io/python-aos-lesson/
