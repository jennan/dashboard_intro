# Intro to Dashboard in Python

This repository provides a quick tour of packages useful to build dashboards in Python.


## Installation

The example notebook runs on Jupyter-on-NeSI.

To run it, you will need a kernel made out of the `Python/3.10.5` environment module:

```
module purge && module load JupyterLab
nesi-add-kernel python-3.10.5 Python/3.10.5-gimkl-2022a
```


## TODO

- complete the demo notebook (add links and some descriptions of toolboxes)
- add a self-contained example of panel + hvplot + xarray for geoscience
- provide an alternative conda environment or requirements.txt file
