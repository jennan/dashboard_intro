# Intro to Dashboard in Python

This repository provides a quick tour of packages useful to build dashboards in Python.


## Installation

The example notebook runs on [Jupyter-on-NeSI](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz), using the kernel `Python 3.10.5 (gimkl-2022a)`.


## Getting started

The presentation will follow the [Dashboard Tour](dashboard_tour.ipynb) notebook.


## TODO

- provide an alternative conda environment or requirements.txt file
- add a self-contained example of panel + hvplot + xarray + datashader for geoscience, maybe use data from https://carpentries-lab.github.io/python-aos-lesson/
